#Blackbox - a RFID project

First phase is to build a state machine, 
also some testing with SSH and GIT done <br>
Use a hexeditor to edit the 1K Mifare template file

Started with a clean Domoticz [https://www.domoticz.com/] SD image[https://sourceforge.net/projects/domoticz/files/], made for Raspberry.
Then in the first config I added SPI and I2C, expanded the filesystem and changed the pi password (yes, you should do this also..)

#Next up
